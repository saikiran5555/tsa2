    "Identifying time-dependent seasonal components in time series data is crucial for understanding and modeling seasonal patterns accurately. Here are some common techniques to identify seasonal components:\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal Subseries Plots: Seasonal subseries plots divide the time series into subsets based on the seasonal period (e.g., months for monthly data). Each subset represents a single season, and plotting these subsets separately allows visual inspection of seasonal patterns across different time periods. Seasonal patterns can be identified by examining the consistency or variability of values within each subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal Decomposition: Seasonal decomposition techniques, such as classical decomposition or STL decomposition (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS), decompose the time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components. By isolating the seasonal component, these techniques help in identifying the presence and characteristics of seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocorrelation Analysis: Autocorrelation function (ACF) plots can reveal the presence of seasonal patterns by showing peaks at multiples of the seasonal period. Significant autocorrelation at specific lags corresponding to the seasonal period indicates the presence of seasonality in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boxplot Analysis: Boxplots of the data grouped by each season can reveal differences in central tendency and variability between seasons. Seasonal patterns may manifest as systematic differences in the distribution of values across seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Series Decomposition Using Regression Models: Regression-based approaches, such as seasonal regression or Fourier terms regression, explicitly model seasonal effects using dummy variables or sinusoidal terms. The coefficients associated with seasonal components in these models provide insights into the magnitude and timing of seasonal variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal Indexes: Seasonal indexes quantify the relative strength of seasonal effects at different times of the year. These indexes can be calculated by dividing the observed values by the corresponding seasonal averages or fitting regression models with seasonal dummy variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "By employing these techniques, analysts can effectively identify time-dependent seasonal components in time series data, which is essential for accurate modeling, forecasting, and decision-making.\n",
